The purpose of this document is to explain how the program works.

The DANCE Alpha Calibrator takes the raw alpha spectra for each run and calibrates them to the DANCE_Alpha_Database.


1) Prerequisites
  
  In the .cpp file make sure all the file paths are correct such that the program can find the rootfiles, the database, and knows where to place the output.  Inputs can be from either the new or old analyzer naming scheme (changed in version 11.3)

  Make sure the DANCE_Alpha_Database is current (The resolution changes occasionally and fits will frequently fail if the spectral shapes of the data and database are discrepant).  See item 3

2) Running the DANCE_Alpha_Calibrator

FOR A Single Run
    ./DANCE_Alpha_Calibrator RUN_NUMBER

FOR A Set of Runs that will all then share the same calibration
    ./DANCE_Alpha_Calibrator RUN_1 RUN_2 ... RUN_N-1 RUN_N

3) Making the DANCE_Alpha_Database

   Run the DANCE_Analysis with source data (Y88 or Na22 works best)
   Run some version of a gamma fitter on the source data extracting the calibrations
   Run the stage1 analysis of the source data with the new calibration files
   Run the DANCE_Alpha_Database_Creator.C script after changing the run numbers of interest.  
   
4) Set last_params.txt
   If you have a calibration file you have closest to the runs you're trying to calibrate   
   If you don't have something nearby, calib_ideal for the appropriate year isn't a terrible choice
